This script generates a list of Bugzilla products that when selected, generate a changelog based off of the target milestone. You have the ability to export the lists to an html or wiki format.

**Installing**

To install, simply upload the directory to the same web server you have bugzilla running on. Enter your bugzilla database connection information into the config.cgi file. Set the permissions properly for all cgi files and you should be off and running.
